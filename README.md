# Bankruptcy-Prediction-Problem

The bankruptcy-prediction problem can be viewed as a problem of classification. The data set for this problem includes one ratio that have been computed from the financial statements of real-world firms. This one ratio has been used in studies involving bankruptcy prediction. The first sample (training set) includes 68 data value on firms that went bankrupt and firms that didn't. This will be your training sample. The second sample (testing set) of 68 firms also consists of some bankrupt firms and some non-bankrupt firms. Your goal is to use different classifiers to build a training model, by randomly selecting the 40 data points (20 points from category 1 and 20 points from category 0), and then test its performance on the testing model by randomly selecting 40 data points from the testing sets.

Some of the classifiers that are used in this project are listed below:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support vector machines
3. Naive Bayes
4. Neural Networks
